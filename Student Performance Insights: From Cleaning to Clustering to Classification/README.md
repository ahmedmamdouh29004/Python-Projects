## üìñ Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of student achievement in secondary education using a dataset from Portuguese schools. The goal is to identify the key factors influencing student performance and to build a predictive model for final grades (G3). The work encompasses thorough data exploration, visualization, and the application of machine learning techniques, all conducted with a strong emphasis on ethical data practices.

## üìä Dataset

*   **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository - [Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
*   **File:** `student-mat.csv` (Math course)
*   **Description:** The dataset contains **395 student records** with **33 attributes** each, including:
    *   **Demographic & Social:** `school`, `sex`, `age`, `address`, `famsize`, `Pstatus`.
    *   **Parental Background:** `Medu` (Mother's education), `Fedu` (Father's education), `Mjob`, `Fjob`.
    *   **Student Habits & Health:** `studytime`, `failures`, `absences`, `health`, `Dalc` (workday alcohol), `Walc` (weekend alcohol).
    *   **Academic Performance:** `G1` (first period grade), `G2` (second period grade), `G3` (final grade).

## üéØ Project Goals

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data related to student performance.
2.  **Predictive Modeling:** Build and compare multiple machine learning models to accurately predict a student's final grade (G3).
3.  **Feature Importance:** Identify the most influential factors that contribute to academic success.
4.  **Actionable Recommendations:** Provide data-driven suggestions for educators and policymakers to improve student outcomes.
5.  **Ethical Considerations:** Address privacy, fairness, and bias concerns in educational data analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Dependencies

This project is built with:
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Core Libraries:**
    *   `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
    *   `numpy` - Numerical computations
    *   `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization and plotting
    *   `scikit-learn` (sklearn) - Machine learning models and preprocessing
*   **Environment:** `jupyter` - Jupyter Notebook/Lab

## üìÅ Project Structure
\## üöÄ How to Run

1\. \*\*Clone the repository\*\* or download the project files.

2\. \*\*(Recommended) Create a virtual environment\*\* and activate it.
\`\`\`bash python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate \# On Windows:
venv\\Scripts\\activate \`\`\`

3\. \*\*Install the required dependencies.\*\* \`\`\`bash pip install -r
requirements.txt \`\`\`

4\. \*\*Launch Jupyter Notebook\*\* and open \`Final_Project.ipynb\`.
\`\`\`bash jupyter notebook \`\`\`

5\. \*\*Run the cells\*\* in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the
entire analysis.

\## üìà Key Insights

\### Data Characteristics - \*\*Imbalanced School Distribution:\*\* Data
from two schools (GP and MS) with majority from GP - \*\*Gender
Imbalance:\*\* Higher representation of female students - \*\*Urban
Dominance:\*\* Most students from urban areas (U) - \*\*Parental
Education:\*\* Most mothers have medium-high education, while many
fathers have only primary education - \*\*High Aspirations:\*\* Nearly
all students plan to pursue higher education

\### Performance Correlations - \*\*Strong Consistency:\*\* G1 and G2
are excellent predictors of final grade (G3) - \*\*Study Time
Impact:\*\* Diminishing returns beyond 3-4 hours of study time -
\*\*Attendance Matters:\*\* Fewer absences correlate with higher
grades - \*\*Parental Education Paradox:\*\* Students with less educated
fathers sometimes performed better, suggesting other influencing factors

\### Student Lifestyle - \*\*Short Commutes:\*\* 90% of students have
\<15min travel time - \*\*Balanced Lifestyle:\*\* Typical free time and
socializing rated 3/5 - \*\*Low Alcohol Use:\*\* Most students report
minimal alcohol consumption - \*\*Good Health:\*\* Majority report good
health (3-5/5)

\## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

Several regression models were trained and evaluated to predict G3: \*
\*\*Linear Regression\*\* (Baseline) \* \*\*Decision Tree Regressor\*\*
\* \*\*Random Forest Regressor\*\* \* \*\*Gradient Boosting
Regressor\*\*

\*\*Evaluation Metrics:\*\* Models were evaluated using \*\*Mean
Absolute Error (MAE)\*\* and \*\*R-squared (R¬≤)\*\*.

\## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

This project adhered to strict ethical guidelines:

\### Privacy and Data Anonymization - \*\*Risk:\*\* Dataset contains
sensitive personal information that could identify students -
\*\*Mitigation:\*\* Used aggregated data for reporting, anonymized early
in analysis

\### Fairness and Algorithmic Bias - \*\*Risk:\*\* Models could
perpetuate existing biases against certain student groups -
\*\*Mitigation:\*\* Audited models for bias across subgroups, careful
feature selection

\### Sensitive Attributes and Stereotyping - \*\*Risk:\*\* Drawing
conclusions based on family background could lead to harmful
stereotypes - \*\*Mitigation:\*\* Framed findings responsibly as
correlations rather than causations

\### Consent and Purpose Limitation - \*\*Risk:\*\* Uncertain if
students/parents consented to data use beyond educational research -
\*\*Mitigation:\*\* Used data only for its intended purpose - improving
student outcomes

\## üéØ Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend:

1\. \*\*Targeted Academic Support:\*\* Implement programs for at-risk
students identified by low G1/G2 scores 2. \*\*Parental Engagement:\*\*
Develop workshops for parents, especially those with lower education
levels 3. \*\*Resource Allocation:\*\* Direct additional resources to
rural students to ensure equity 4. \*\*Attendance Monitoring:\*\*
Implement early warning systems for rising absenteeism 5. \*\*Digital
Access:\*\* Bridge the digital divide for students without internet
access 6. \*\*Support for Older Students:\*\* Create tailored programs
for repeating students
