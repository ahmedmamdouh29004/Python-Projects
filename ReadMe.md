# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster  

## Project Overview  
This project applies data science techniques to the Titanic dataset in order to predict passenger survival.  
The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and reflection.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the following link:
